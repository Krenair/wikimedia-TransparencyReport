  <h2>Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.</h2>
  <p>
    The Wikimedia projects make up the world's largest repository of human knowledge. With that much freely available information, someone is bound to get upset by some of the content from time to time. Every year, we receive requests to remove or change material that has been posted onto a Wikimedia project.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the Wikimedia projects are yours, not ours. People just like you from around the world write, upload, edit, and curate all of the content. Therefore, we believe users should decide what belongs on Wikimedia projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below, you will find more information about the number of requests we receive, where they come from, and how they could impact free knowledge. You can also learn more about how we fight for freedom of speech through our defense of user programs in the FAQ.

  <h2>DMCA Takedown Notices</h2>
  <p>
   The Wikimedia community is made up of creators, collectors, and consumers of free knowledge. While most material appearing on Wikimedia projects is in the public domain or openly licensed, occasionally copyrighted material makes it way onto the projects.
 </p>
  <p>
    The Wikimedia Foundation is obligated under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) to remove copyright-infringing material upon receipt of a proper takedown request. When we receive a DMCA takedown request, we thoroughly evaluate the request to ensure that it is valid. If we believe it is, we remove the allegedly infringing content and we are transparent about that removal. If we do not believe it is valid, we will push back as appropriate. To learn more about DMCA procedures, see our DMCA policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below, we have provided information about the DMCA takedown notices we have received in the past and how we responded to them.
