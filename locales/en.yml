    lead: "<a target='_blank' href='http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Vision'>Our mission</a> is to provide free access to the sum of all human knowledge. We believe that protecting user privacy and defending against censorship are essential to the success of that mission. Every year, we receive requests from governments, individuals, and organizations to disclose information about our users or to delete or alter content on our projects. Some are legitimate. Some are not.<br /> <br />The purpose of this transparency report is to shed light on the requests we receive and how we respond to them."

    lead: "<a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Guiding_Principles#Free_speech'>Freedom of speech is essential</a> to the Wikimedia movement—our projects cannot flourish in an ecosystem where individuals cannot speak freely. Our users trust us to protect their identities against unlawful disclosure and we take this responsibility seriously."
    intro: "<p>However, every year, governments, individuals, and corporations ask us to disclose user data. Often, we have no nonpublic information to disclose because we <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#Types_of_Information_We_Receive_From_You.2C_How_We_Get_It.2C_.26_How_We_Use_It'>collect little nonpublic information</a> about users and retain that information for a <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_retention_guidelines'>short period of time</a>. But when we do have data, we carefully evaluate every request before considering disclosure. If the requests do not meet our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines'>standards</a>—if they are overly broad, unclear, or irrelevant—we will push back on behalf of our users.</p><p>If we must produce information due to a legally valid request, we will notify the affected user before we disclose, if we are legally permitted and have the means to do so. In certain cases, we may help find assistance for users to fight an invalid request.</p><p>Below, you will find more information about the requests for user data we receive.</p>"
